# [Sudoku Solver](https://pavlyuchenko.github.io/Sudoku/)

**A project I made for fun after feeling burnt out. It fulfilled its purpose and put me back on track.**

It is written in Vanilla JS and it features nothing interesting in particular, but I implemented a **backtracking algorithm** that can solve the sudoku.

It has a minimalistic but nice design, is responsive, checks if you are not violating any rules and can be navigated purely using keyboard.
